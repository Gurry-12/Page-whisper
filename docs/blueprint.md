## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#4B0082) to evoke a sense of mystery, knowledge, and sophistication.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F0F0), almost white, providing a clean and readable backdrop.
- Accent color: Soft Lavender (#E6E6FA) to complement the indigo, adding a touch of calm and sophistication. The primary and accent colors are analogous, near to each other on the color wheel, with soft lavender providing a contrasting highlight due to its difference in saturation and brightness.
- Headline font: 'Playfair' (serif) for an elegant, fashionable, high-end feel; body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body copy, offering good readability and a clean, modern aesthetic. Font pairing recommended to create clear typographic hierarchy.
- Simple, line-based icons for navigation and actions. Icons should be in the accent color, soft lavender, to maintain a cohesive look.
- Clean and spacious layout with a focus on readability and ease of navigation. Use of white space to create a sense of calm and order.
- Subtle transitions and animations for interactive elements (e.g., hover effects, page transitions) to enhance user experience without being distracting.
